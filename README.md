# USACO
My personal repository for completed USACO training pages.  Gotta practice to get to platinum!
## Orginization
Each folder is representative of one problem from the [USACO Training Gateway](http://train.usaco.org). Each has it's own README which explains each problem and it's input and output.
## Solutions
For the time being, all solutions in this repo are in C++, some requiring C++11. Each folder contains it's own CMakeLists and Makefile to allow for simple compilation.
## New Problems
To add a new problem, you can simply run projectGen.sh which will generate a new problem folder with all neccessary files inside, so you can just get to coding.
